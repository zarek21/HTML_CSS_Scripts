## 🎯 Repository Goal

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal record of my progress and as a practical tool to solidify the fundamental concepts of modern web development. Here, I apply and experiment with:

- **Semantic HTML5:** Structuring content logically and accessibly.
- **Modern CSS3:** Bringing designs to life with techniques like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and animations.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring web pages look and function perfectly on any device, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- **Web Design Principles:** Applying UI/UX concepts to create intuitive and pleasant user experiences.
