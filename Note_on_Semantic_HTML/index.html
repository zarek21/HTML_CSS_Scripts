<!--
  SEMANTIC HTML: The practice of using HTML tags that describe the
  MEANING and PURPOSE of their content, not their appearance.

  Why?
  1. ACCESSIBILITY (a11y): Allows screen readers to navigate and
     understand the page structure.
  2. SEO: Helps search engines index and rank content more
     effectively.

  Golden Rule: Choose the tag that best describes what you are doing.
  (e.g., <nav> for navigation, not just a <div>).
